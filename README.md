Overview of the Inventory Management System Project
The Inventory Management System is a Python-based application designed to help businesses (such as stores or warehouses) manage their product inventory efficiently. This program provides functionalities to track products, manage stock levels, and generate reports. It features a graphical user interface (GUI) for easy interaction, user authentication, product management, and reporting. The system uses SQLite as the database to store user and product information.

Key Features of the System:
User Authentication:

The system allows users to register and log in securely.
User passwords are stored securely in the database using bcrypt for password hashing.
Only authenticated users can access the main inventory features, ensuring security.
Product Management:

Users can add new products to the inventory with details such as name, quantity, and price.
Edit and delete products to keep the inventory updated.
View the list of all products currently in the inventory with relevant details.
Inventory Tracking:

Track inventory levels by maintaining the quantity of each product.
Low stock alerts: The system notifies when a product's stock quantity falls below a threshold (5 or less).
Sales report generation: Provides a summary of total sales, calculated as the total value of products based on quantity and price.
Database Management:

The application uses an SQLite database to store user data (for authentication) and product data (name, quantity, price).
The system ensures that the products table holds product details and that the users table stores credentials (username and hashed password).
Graphical User Interface (GUI):

Built using Tkinter, the GUI is user-friendly and intuitive, making it easy for users to interact with the system.
The interface includes various screens:
Login screen for user authentication.
Main screen for managing products and viewing reports.
Product management forms for adding/editing products.
Reports screen to display low-stock alerts and sales summaries.
Data Validation:

The system ensures data is entered correctly (e.g., ensuring that the quantity is a number and the price is a valid floating-point number).
There are validation checks for logging in and for adding/editing product details.
System Workflow:
User Registration and Login:

When the program is first run, users must register or use the default credentials (e.g., username admin and password password123).
Once authenticated, the user can access the main features of the inventory system.
Managing Products:

On the main screen, users can:
Add products: Enter product details such as name, quantity, and price.
View products: The list of all products, including their current stock and price, is displayed.
Edit products: Modify product details if needed.
Delete products: Remove products from the inventory.
Inventory Monitoring:

The Low Stock Alerts screen shows products with quantities lower than or equal to 5.
Sales report generation allows the user to view the total sales by calculating the revenue from all products.
Technologies Used:
Python: The core programming language used to develop the application.
SQLite: A lightweight database to store users' credentials and product information.
Tkinter: A built-in Python library used to create the graphical user interface (GUI).
bcrypt: A library used for securely hashing passwords to ensure safe authentication.
System Flow:
Login/Register Flow:

The user is presented with a login screen. If the user doesn't exist, they can register by providing a new username and password.
After logging in successfully, they can access the main functionalities of the inventory system.
Product Management Flow:

On the main screen, users can add a new product by entering its name, quantity, and price.
Existing products can be modified or deleted based on user input.
Report Generation:

Users can generate low-stock alerts, which will display products that are low in quantity.
Users can also generate a sales report, which summarizes total sales based on the product quantities and prices.
Benefits of the Inventory Management System:
User Security:

Passwords are hashed and stored securely in the database, ensuring user credentials are protected.
Efficiency:

Helps businesses keep track of product stock levels, enabling timely restocking.
Provides quick access to important information such as sales totals and low stock products.
Ease of Use:

With a GUI powered by Tkinter, the application is easy to use, even for users with minimal technical experience.
Customizable:

The system can be extended or modified to add more features such as sales tracking, order management, or supplier tracking.
Future Enhancements:
User Roles:

Implement user roles like Admin and Manager with different levels of access to various features (e.g., only admins can delete products).
Password Reset Feature:

Add a password reset functionality in case users forget their passwords.
Stock Alerts via Email:

Integrate email notifications for low stock alerts to keep managers informed in real time.
Enhanced Reporting:

Add more advanced reporting, such as monthly sales summaries, product-wise sales, and profit calculations.
Barcode Scanner Integration:

Implement barcode scanning for easier product entry and inventory tracking.
